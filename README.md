The LinkedIn Lead Gen repository is built to generate leads based off of engagement on a linkedin post, and provide context on leads generated.

The software scrapes linkedin profiles that engaged with a LinkedIn profile, and gathers data relevant to a B2B company evaluating lead quality. It ranks leads by priority, then exports retrieved data to a CSV file, clear and ready for the use of a sales team.

On a post with 100+ engagements, the software retrieves on average 4-5 high value leads that would be otherwise overlooked.
