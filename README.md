# linkedInScraper

The LinkedIn Scraper is built to provide context on leads generated.

This scraper works hand-in-hand with PhantomBuster, a paid webscraper. With PhantomBuster, you can retrieve a csv file containing links to all accounts that have interacted with posts from a specific LinkedIn account. This can be helpful in tracking accounts that have engaged with content from your industry. 

However, PhantomBuster simply retrieves the list of accounts, with the manner in which they interacted (likes, comments, etc). It fails to provide relevant information that could be crucial in lead-tracking, such as:

- the company of which an individual works at
- the size of an individual's company
- the position an individual holds in said company

These factors are crucial in understanding the relevancy of leads. With this package, you can retrieve relevant data to target more qualified leads.
